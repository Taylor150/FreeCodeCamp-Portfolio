# FreeCodeCamp-Portfolio
Portfolio for my FreeCodeCamp Submissions and Certifications

This is a place I plan to submit all of my previous and ongoing freecodecamp challenge submissions. At the time of writing this I have completed 4 out of the 5 challenges in order to complete the 'Responsive Web Design module'. After completion I plan to continue on to the next module which is 'JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures'.
