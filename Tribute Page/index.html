<h2>A breif summary of information of the musician and artist, simon stalenhag.</h2>
<p id="tribute-info">Simon Stålenhag (born 20 January 1984) is a Swedish artist, musician, and designer specialising in retro-futuristic digital images focused on nostalgic Swedish countryside alternate history environments. The settings of his artwork have formed the basis for an Amazon television drama series called Tales from the Loop (2020), among other things.</p>
<br>
<p id="tribute-info">Stålenhag grew up in a rural environment near Stockholm, making illustrations of the local landscape inspired by artists such as Lars Jonsson. He only attempted science fiction artwork after discovering concept artists like Ralph McQuarrie and Syd Mead; initially this body of work was done as a side-project, without any planning behind it. Thematically, his work often combines his childhood with themes from sci-fi movies, resulting in a stereotypical Swedish landscape with a neofuturistic bent. According to Stålenhag, this focus originates from his perceived lack of connection with adulthood, with the science fiction elements being added in part to draw audience attention and partly to influence the work's mood. These ideas result in a body of work that can feature giant robots and megastructures alongside regular Swedish items like Volvo and Saab cars.</p>
<br>
<p id="tribute-info">Most of Stålenhag's artwork was initially available online, before later being released for sale as prints. Since then, it has been turned into two narrative art books, Tales from the Loop (Swedish Ur Varselklotet) in 2014 and (Swedish Flodskörden) Things from the Flood in 2016. Both focus on the construction of a supermassive particle accelerator called the Loop. More recently, Stålenhag has covered the western United States in a third artbook, The Electric State, which was also crowdfunded via Kickstarter. It is centered around a girl and her robotic companion traversing the fictional state of Pacifica. Skybound Books published a North American edition of the work in October 2018.</p>
